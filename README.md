**FrequencyCalc** is a final solution class, which implements methods:
- GetInputFromCommandLine()
- Calculate()
- print()
- SaveToFile()

My assumptions:
- Key has to be a valid set of characters
- Any invalid character in the input (phrase we are checking) is considered to be the end of the word. For example "test$one#t w&o" breaks into the words: test, one, t, w, o
